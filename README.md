A 2D point and click game, product of a group project, in which Engineers, Designers and Artist come together to develop a game in 2 weeks.

## Overview

You are playing as a man named William. He boarded the Austrian night train because he has an important family meeting he has to get to as soon as possible.
Since it’s been a long train ride, William happened to fall asleep in one of the train’s carriages. He happens to dream about a series of weird but realistic events.
Eventually, William wakes up from the nightmare and sees the events he dreamed of take place right before his eyes. Can he figure out how to prevent what is about to happen?
